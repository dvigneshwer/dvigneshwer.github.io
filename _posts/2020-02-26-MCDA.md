I'm blogging after a very long time now and it's for a good reason actually - I'm planning to document all my optimization learning, which is a new area that I have been exploring for sometime now. 

Optimization in my view let's you make good decisions and beauty about the math behind all the optimization algos is that you end up with a result which will help you take an informed decision. 

## Multiple-criteria decision analysis

This analysis in simple word helps you make decision based on a lot of real world criterias! Comes under the operational research discipline 

### Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP)

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. 

We all make decisions in every point of life, look at pros and cons and come up with the best decision that suits the need. AHP works in a simillar way,

Wide range of applications exists: 
* Selecting a car for purchasing
* Deciding upon a place to visit for vacation
* Deciding upon an MBA program after graduation

AHP algorithm is basically composed of two steps: 
1. Determine the relative weights of the decision criteria 
2. Determine the relative rankings (priorities) of alternatives

Let's take example of Car selection, 

Objective: Selecting the best car 
Criteria: Style, Reliability, Fuel-economy Cost? 
Options: Civic Coupe, Saturn Coupe, Ford Escort, Mazda Miata
